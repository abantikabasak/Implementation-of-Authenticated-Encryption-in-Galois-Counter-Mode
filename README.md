# Implementation of Authenticated Encryption in Galois Counter Mode
Implementation of AES-GCM Mode of Operation using 128-bit key in C Programming Language and verification of the outputs with some of the sample test cases. This Mode of Operation is then parallelised using OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) to obtain better performance.
